snapitqr.com and snapiturl.com should be sharing the same free tier and paid tier in aws / stripe

if a user signs in to snapitqr.com or snapiturl.com they can use either web app / api from the same account.

users of snapiturl.com can make qr codes and dynamic qr codes for thier snapiturl.com short urls.

users of snapitqr.com can make short urls with click tracking for thier qr codes or dynamic qr codes or they can also make snapitqr.com short urls

snapiturl.com users can make snapiturl.com or snapitqr.com short urls

border colors

border thickness

qr code design

background of the qr code

and more

if a user creates a qr code then they can save it, download it, print it, or edit it.

free users get 1 dynamic qr code which is stored in dynamo db and the user gets the ability to update the destination link at will up to once per day

free users get up to 3 free short urls that they can customize using the snapiturl.com or snapitqr.com short link or they can randomize it

no user can use the same short link

all short links are saved in dynamo db and the users dashboard

users can delete qr codes or short urls and that will delete them from dynamo and free up the name again

if short links or qr codes are not used for 90 days they are archived if they are not used after 180 days they are deleted from our dynamo db

but users can make as many static qr codes as they want they will be stored locally on thier device only the dynamic qr codes will have the images stored on the users s3 and the destination links stored in dynamo

short links will create a s3 page that tracks all user information before redirecting the user to the destination link and storing all of that data in our users dynamo db in order to show them on the dashboard how many clicks and visits thier qr code or short url is getting and all the information that we can about those visitors
